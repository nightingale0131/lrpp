# Learned Reactive Policy (LRPP)
LRPP implementation on a simple grid

A demo can be ran by executing the following in the LRPP folder:

python main.py -e "../environments/maze.dat" -s "20 20" -g "20 1" -t 20 

GIF videos and images will be saved in results/videos and results/figures respectively.

For more details on algorithm, refer to the following paper:
